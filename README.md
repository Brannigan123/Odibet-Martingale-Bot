# Odibet-Martingale-Bot
<br/>
A version of the martingale strategy someone wanted an implementation for.<br/>
<br/>
In theory the algorithm is full-proof if there aren't any infinitely long streaks of losses and if there is infinitely flow of cash present for staking.<br/>
In reality since the outcomes are never just losses, one still needs large sums amount of cash to cushion the growing stake in case of a loosing streak and recovering on the very first win afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, this is not a guaranteed way of making money.
